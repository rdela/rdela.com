**Update 4 April 2019:**
The title of John Gruber’s roundup post,
 [BBEdit Returns to the Mac App Store](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/04/04/bbedit-mac-app-store),
 says it all. Includes links to
 [@pschiller’s&nbsp;tweet](https://twitter.com/pschiller/status/1113838263842693120)
 and the App Store features on BBEdit (my fav:
 [“BBEdit: A Writer’s Secret&nbsp;Weapon”](https://itunes.apple.com/us/story/id1451975928)).

In addition to its unmatched ability to process and operate on insanely large
 files smoothly, without missing a beat, BBEdit comes well-configured out of
 the box and is easy to customize to your liking. I also like
 [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) and
 [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for general text and code editing,
 and am digging [Slugline](https://slugline.co/) for&nbsp;screenplays.
