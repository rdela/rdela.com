In addition to its unmatched ability to process and operate on insanely large
 files smoothly, without missing a beat, BBEdit comes well-configured out of
 the box and is easy to customize to your liking. I also like
 [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) and
 [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for general text and code editing, and
 am digging [Slugline](https://slugline.co/) for&nbsp;screenplays.
