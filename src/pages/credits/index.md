Welcome to the new [rdela.com](https://rdela.com). I will be your host,
Ricky de&nbsp;Laveaga.

I began developing this site with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
by running&nbsp;a:

```shell
git clone
```

‚Ä¶of
[gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)[^gatsby-new],
the Gatsby starter for creating a blog
([demo](https://gatsbyjs.github.io/gatsby-starter-blog/)), which has
[Typography.js](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typography.js)
bundled, whose
[demo&nbsp;playground](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/)
is a fun way to noodle out a proto<em><strong>type</strong>&nbsp;design</em>.

Anyhoo, as of this post I am using a
[modified version](https://github.com/rdela/rdela.com/blob/master/src/utils/typography.js)
of the
[GitHub&nbsp;theme](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typography.js/tree/master/packages/typography-theme-github).
After much staring at the screen and tweaking CSS, had to include the inimitable
trio of [Source&nbsp;Serif](https://typekit.com/fonts/source-serif)
by [Frank&nbsp;Grie√ühammer](https://typekit.com/designers/frank-griesshammer),
[Source&nbsp;Sans](https://typekit.com/fonts/source-sans)
by [Paul&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Hunt](https://typekit.com/designers/paul-d-hunt),
and
[Source&nbsp;Code&nbsp;Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/source-sans)
by [Paul&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Hunt](https://typekit.com/designers/paul-d-hunt) and
[Teo&nbsp;Tuominen](https://typekit.com/designers/teo-tuominen). All 3 are
part of the
[_Adobe&nbsp;Originals_](https://blog.typekit.com/category/making-type/)&nbsp;series.

[Typefaces](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces) makes
including NPM packages for open source typefaces and self-hosting webfonts
significantly easier. Library author Kyle Mathews explained the motivations
[in&nbsp;January&nbsp;2017](https://www.bricolage.io/typefaces-easiest-way-to-self-host-fonts/).

Though the `shell¬±git clone` example above hardly does it justice,
gatsby-remark-prismjs ([docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-prismjs/), [on&nbsp;GitHub](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-remark-prismjs))
makes adding ‚Äúsyntax highlighting to code blocks in markdown files‚Äù using
[Prism](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) a drop-in affair with a line in
[gatsby-config.js](https://github.com/rdela/rdela.com/blob/master/gatsby-config.js#L42)
and another in
[layouts/index.js](https://github.com/rdela/rdela.com/blob/master/src/layouts/index.js#L15).
I have settled on a [slight variation](https://github.com/rdela/rdela.com/blob/master/src/css/prism/prism-day-after-tomorrow.css) the ‚Äúprism.js tomorrow night eighties‚Äù
[theme](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/blob/gh-pages/themes/prism-tomorrow.css),
itself based on
[Tomorrow&nbsp;Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme).

I cannot neglect to _issue_ a hearty thanks to all of the
[Gatsby GitHub people](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/graphs/contributors)
along with all of the [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/) authors and
[contributors](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/graphs/contributors).
For solid examples of common patterns in Gatsby and React, the
[reactjs.org&nbsp;repo](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org) and
[gatsbyjs.org&nbsp;code](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/www)
are both superb open learning resources in the wild.
[bricolage.io](https://www.bricolage.io/) by Kyle Mathews
([repo](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/blog))
is maybe less generally useful while also being more approachable and
especially helpful to me in putting this&nbsp;together.

**UPDATE 20 November 2019:** I have been using Algolia search since 24 July 2019
via [gatsby-plugin-algolia](https://github.com/algolia/gatsby-plugin-algolia),
thanks to the
[excellent example by Janosh Riebesell](https://janosh.io/blog/gatsby-algolia-search)
that has become
[part of the Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-search-with-algolia/). I don‚Äôt think either article has been updated for changes [React InstantSearch](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch) made in
[v6](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/blob/master/MIGRATION.md#upgrade-to-6xx)
to adopt React 16.3+‚Äôs [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) API, but
[Janosh‚Äôs repo](https://github.com/janosh/janosh.io/tree/master/src/components/Search) and
[this one](https://github.com/rdela/rdela.com/tree/master/src/components/search)
have been updated, in case that helps intrepid folks trying to make
the&nbsp;switch.

As an instant bonus for reading all the way down, I give you&nbsp;the‚Ä¶

[^gatsby-new]: Having already installed `shell¬±gatsby-cli`, One could run: `shell¬±gatsby new mySite https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog` ‚Ä¶in the terminal instead of a `shell¬±git clone` of the [gatsby-starter-blog repo](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) like I did, which then needs to be followed by a `shell¬±yarn` or `shell¬±npm i` before running `shell¬±gatsby develop` for the first time. The [Gatsby&nbsp;Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) start with the `shell¬±gatsby new` command which takes care of this initial package install. (For more on `shell¬±git` and cloning, see [git-clone docs](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-clone).) The source of the `shell¬±gatsby new` command is split between [create-cli.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby-cli/src/create-cli.js) and [init-starter.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby-cli/src/init-starter.js) in the Gatsby&nbsp;repo.
