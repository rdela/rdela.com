**UPDATE 22 November 2019:** Thanks once again to Troy Hunt and Have I Been
Pwned, today I found out I my email address was among [over 622 million unique
email addresses exposed in a data breach of an index indicating it was sourced
from People Data Labs
(PDL)](https://www.troyhunt.com/data-enrichment-people-data-labs-and-another-622m-email-addresses/).
This section really resonates with&nbsp;me:

> The recurring theme I'm finding with exposed data of this nature is increasing
> outrage that the data aggregator obtained and used personal information in a
> fashion the owner of the data (i.e. me) didn't consent to. It's not about how
> public the data might be through the channels people choose to publish it,
> rather it's about the use of the data outside its intended context. […] And
> this is the real problem: regardless of how well these data enrichment
> companies secure their own system, once they pass the data downstream to
> customers it's completely out of their control. My data—almost certainly
> your data too—is replicated, mishandled and exposed and there's absolutely
> nothing we can do about it. Well, almost&nbsp;nothing…

After reading [Troy’s post](https://www.troyhunt.com/data-enrichment-people-data-labs-and-another-622m-email-addresses/), I wrote the following to

If your data is in the breach, I suggest you do the same.
[Visit HIBP](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to check. Here is [the breach summary

Did you have an Evite account as of August&nbsp;2013?

‘*Why August 2013?…*’ you might ask. Well it seems Evite’s systems were breached sometime around February 22, 2019, and that they became aware of this “malicious activity” in April 2019, apparently when [ZDNet notified Evite](https://www.zdnet.com/article/evite-e-invite-website-admits-security-breach/) the data was for sale on the dark&nbsp;web.

In this compromise, the attackers made off with a database archive, old data from&nbsp;2013:

> On May 14, 2019, we concluded that an unauthorized party had acquired an inactive data storage file associated with our user&nbsp;accounts.

– FAQ #1 from [Evite’s “Data Incident” notice](https://www.evite.com/security/update?usource=lc&lctid=1800182)

There is also a notice at Have I Been Pwned (which is how I found out about the breach on July 14) which&nbsp;lists:

> **Compromised data:** Dates of birth, Email addresses, Genders, Names, Passwords, Phone numbers, Physical&nbsp;addresses

HIBP’s summary is:

> In April 2019, the social planning website for managing online invitations Evite identified a data breach of their systems. Upon investigation, they found unauthorised access to a database archive dating back to 2013. The exposed data included a total of 101 million unique email addresses, most belonging to recipients of invitations. Members of the service also had names, phone numbers, physical addresses, dates of birth, genders and passwords stored in plain text&nbsp;exposed.

If you are asking yourself, ‘*OK but what am I supposed to do?…*’ your best bet is to check your Evite password. If you know that you have reused that password elsewhere, particularly on financial or email accounts, **change those passwords now**. Likely damage would have already been done, since apparently the stolen data has been for sale since April, but better late than never when it comes to protecting yourself. If you are unsure whether you still have an account, go to [evite.com/login](https://www.evite.com/login) and, if needed, request a password reset email with the “Forgot Your Password?” link at the bottom of the form to determine if your email address has an associated&nbsp;account.
