ðŸ§µ Should Humans Colonize Other Planets? [â€¦] [ðŸ”—](https://twitter.com/astro_jaz/status/1293691852575604739)

ðŸ’­ Why wouldn't we? [ðŸ”—](https://twitter.com/philosophene/status/1293786978740088834)

ðŸ’¬ If we cannot survive here where we evolved for billions of years in adaptation to the environment why would we fare better anywhere else? [ðŸ”—](https://twitter.com/rickydelaveaga/status/1293802856965787652)

ðŸ’¬ So the argument is to just give up? [ðŸ”—](https://twitter.com/philosophene/status/1293806934189936640)

ðŸ’¬ Resolve not to give up or give in to escapism. To focus on repairing our damage instead of exhausting crucial resources further to chase fantasies of permanently existing elsewhere. Exploration and observation are science; exploitation and colonization are fever dreams. [ðŸ”—](https://twitter.com/rickydelaveaga/status/1293811488948273152)[^edited]
