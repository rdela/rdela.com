**Update 25 February 2018:** If you are having trouble with Netlify the answer is very often “Retry deploy” with “[Clear build cache](https://www.netlify.com/docs/build-gotchas/#build-cache)” checked.

According to the [web&nbsp;UI](https://www.netlify.com/docs/), I have been publishing projects from GitHub with Netlify for 4 months now (since 24 Oct. 2017), including [this&nbsp;site](https://github.com/rdela/rdela.com).

Odds are high I will write more about this soon. At this point, I can recommend them to anyone looking to host static sites with them, whether [open&nbsp;source](https://www.netlify.com/open-source/) or [private&nbsp;repos](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/06/28/introducing-teams-new-features-and-an-update-to-our-plans/):
