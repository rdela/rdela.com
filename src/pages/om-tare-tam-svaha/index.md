*Excerpted from Sounds True’s [Songs of Tara](https://www.soundstrue.com/store/songs-of-tara-2462.html):*

> Tara is venerated by Hindus and Buddhists alike, and seems to predate Tantric Buddhism in India as a Hindu deity. Scholars note many links between her and ancient forms of the goddess Durga. Her Indian name, Tara, means “Star,” but it is also a form of the word that means “to ferry" or “to carry across,” which relates more closely to the literal meaning of her Tibetan name. […] Tara’s “seed syllable,” a single, untranslatable sound that expresses her entire essence, is *Tam*. The mantra *Om Tare Tam Svaha* (or, in Tibetan pronunciation, *Soha*) is thus know as her “heart song” and is sometimes associated with the more wrathful form of Red Tara, whose practice brings wisdom and awareness of our ultimate nature. […] A Tibetan nun [[Jetsun Ani Rinpoche](/jetsun-ani-rinpoche/)] with a voice straight from primordial space pierces our hearts with the mantra *Om Tare Tam&nbsp;Svaha*.
