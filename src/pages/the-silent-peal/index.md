  alt="A surreal landcsape in a yellowish light: A giant pail being filled by a metal spout in a looming, ribbed tree that resembles an oak, a strange figure in a wide brimmed hat with at least six arms holding a curved staff bending over the roots of the tree, barrren shrubs, and birdlike creatures in the sky above the figure and the shubs but still beneath the branches of the tree."
