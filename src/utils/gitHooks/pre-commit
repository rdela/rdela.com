# Pre-commit hook executed before every `git commit`.
# To activate, change git's hook directory to:
# git config core.hooksPath src/utils/gitHooks

# It looks for scripts in ./pre-commit.d directory and executes them in order,
# passing along stdin. If any script exits with a non-zero status, this script exits.
